# On Walled Gardens in Organizational Structures

There exists this implicit need to subdivide responsibility into particular fields. And it occurred to me, some time ago, that the reasoning might, instead, be something we're taking for granted. For example, who's to say that Engineers need more math than literature? Good developers are typically equally proficient writers. In addition to being voracious readers of both long form and short form text, documentation, and books of all genres. 

This thinking does, in fact, extend. We have Programmers, Developers, Engineers, DevOps, Site Reliability Engineers, DevSecOps, Data, Systems, and the list goes on and on. Where do you draw the lines? Why are the lines drawn there? Why is proficiency not the indicator of all things? I have so very many questions but so few answers. 

The incredible amount of specialization is a result of engineers trying to carve out an increasingly limited amount of information that they can then call themselves expert over. This is not the natural state of an engineer. The natural state of an engineer is "curious". Think back to the Xerox Parc days. If you wanted to an engineer you needed to know a little bit of hardware, a little bit of firmware, and a decent amount of software. All those traits together produced some of the most revolutionary products the world has ever seen.
