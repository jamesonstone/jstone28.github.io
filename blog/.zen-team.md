# Zen and the Art of Team Culture

This post, in a lot of ways, has been brewing in my mind for a while. I've had the opportunity to work for many high performing teams, and have been lucky enough to be exposed to some of the smartest people our industry has to offer. In addition to being able to contrast that with teams that were lower performing, and less possessed with finding the optimal solution; so without further ado: Zen and the Art of Team Culture

Culture is transient. It's fluid. It changes with the ebb and flow of people coming and going. Like a leaf dancing in the wind.

Culture is much like a garden. It must be tended and worked, groomed and seeded. If left untended, the most beautiful of flowers will dissolve and what will take their place are the bad and the worse. And just like a garden, it's not impossible to revivify it but the process is arduous and trying, and you will lose many of the flowers you valued most in the process.

### Start With the Why

### Communication in Large Scale, Hierarchical Systems is More Complex But Not More Difficult

Companies that work at scale do so with intense focus on communication. You see it deeply intertwined into the culture, itself. Information flows like a wind through wheat. There are no silos or information-as-currency teams, and if there are, they're rooted out quickly.

Communication is hard.

### Honesty Over Everything

Being able to tell the truth is the only way two parties can effectively aim at the transended good. Beyond what is right for the two in

### It's Not What You Preach, It's What You Tolerate

A sergeant walking down the street in New York in uniform when she passes a young private in uniform. The uniformed private is walking with his hands in his pockets and gives a half hearted salute as he passes by. In that moment, the sargent is captivated by a thought: this private is lazy and would normally be reprimanded for this time of laziness in salute on base but we're not on base and in a civilian atmosphere so perhaps I should let this slide. Almost immediately, another thought diverts her thinking: "if i do nothing. This private will think that this type of behavior is ok or, at the very least, think that environment changes allow for a different sort of mindset and attitude.

Before the young private passes, she instantly calls to him: Get your hands out of your pockets, stand up straight, and salute me correctly! The private, startled by the unanticipated yell from a superior officer instantly does what's ask while still trying to pick his jaw off the floor. "Report to my office in the morning, private. Dismissed."

Hold each other accountable (trust)

poor performers must go - toxic people (people aren't culture fits) must go as well
Often this is topic is broached with hostility. If someone doesn't fit with your company's culture it is looked upon as a bad thing, as something that's almost taboo. The truth is quite the contrary. Groups are defined by who they exclude. If an individual doesn't fit in your companies culture, you should bid them the best of luck in their future endeavors and go your separate ways.

### Mindset is Everything

In the Steve Jobs biography there are several pages that reference a "reality distortion field". Early employees of Apple describe how, in the presence of Steve Jobs, they were magnetically drawn in to tough deadlines and a break neck pace. Like a moth to flame, what would take 8 weeks would suddenly be 4 when they presented to Steve Jobs.

When I first read that I thought it to be a whole lot of bullshit. How could one man be so persuasive, so charismatic to make even the strongest and most well respected engineers bend over backwards to meet Steve's own inconceivable timelines.

All that changed when I finally met the right people. If you

It's the same reason that modern day warfare is fought by small, highly specialized and multi-talented teams, and not a bruit force of 5000 troops standing in a row.

## Discipline Equals Freedom

Real listening is a lost art - carl rodgers and summating before moving on - language is an incredibly variable level of abstraction
The great psychoanalyst often comment on how wondrous communication is. When step back for a second and realize how powerful language is, you realize that every conversation has the potential to be something life changing. In more abstract terms, when I'm communicating, I have some shapes in my head that represent what I'm trying to communicate. I then pass that through my lips in words that are individually selected so that they can revivify those images in your head once they've passed between us.

Words themselves hold unbelievable amounts of meaning. For example, the word water can mean the the life-giving element that sustains us all, it can mean the act of transferring life to another object, say in the instance that you water a plant. It can be conjoined with other words to have a negative connotation such as to "water down" or backwater but that single 5 letter word has almost infinite potential.

It's in that vein that listening. Real listening. Has become a lost art. The value and potential of words are overlooked, rushed, and ignored as they act as spacers between individual speakers. That's why effective teams value real listening. There's a lot less communication that has to happen, a lot less walls that have to be put up, and a lot less processes that have to be put in place when two individuals can speak and listen in complete synchronicity.

### Don't Over Specialize

The best engineers I have known have never been overspecialized. The see skills as a product on the shelf from which they can take and put back as they need. The engineer who mentored me used to say: "the best engineers don't memorize. They simply remember where to find things. This allows them a wide breadth of knowledge".

Another example of this comes from the book The Phoenix Project. The security guy, John,  is screaming his head off about security issues but doesn't recognize their insignificance in the overall project's success. Consequently, his character slowly disappears into the ether; later to be reborn as an entirely different person who has reconciled with his lack of significance in overall projects success.

In a world of people completely obsessed with being the absolute best in some domain no matter how thin a slice it becomes, be someone who has the attitude and mindset to move through topics fluidly. Instead of restricting your interests to a topic or domain, open them up. Read the classics. Open every text on every topic you can find and follow what interests you (even if it doesn't initially)

Innovation in any space requires a breadth of knowledge on the topic combined with a depth of knowledge on the problem. Teams that are able to find that combination are poised for success.

### Critical Thinking Over Working Harder

I once worked with a guy who was lauded for his hard work. His omnipresent-like ability to stay connected, and his seemingly insatiable appetite for effort. He was

### Always be Prepared to Answer Why

Great organizations have been built entirely by simply asking one question: why?

### Humility is the Highest Virtue

### If You Have a Problem With Someone Talk to Them - *distance breeds distance*

### Aim For the Highest Good

### Every Problem is a Leadership Problem

Whenever I discuss leadership, I almost immediately jump to an example within the military. Who better to claim expertise then developed over 1000s of years and tested, and retested time and time again.

As a non-military person, when I think about how the military is organized from an abstract perspective, i see layers of domain owners each with clear and concise duties. I see those layers overlap into a pattern that mimics kevlar in its interconnectedness.
