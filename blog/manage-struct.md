# Why Management Structures Dictate Software Architecture

[Conway's Law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_law) a perennial favorite for being quoted around the office defines how software architecture tends towards the communication (and by extension, the management structure) of the organization

> [...] organizations which design systems ... are constrained to produce designs which are copies of the communication structures of these organizations.
>
> — M. Conway

Why is it that this law from the 1960 still holds true today? I think I've gotten some where in my thinking about why that is. Unfortunately, it's not all that innovative or surprising but using [Occam's Razor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occam%27s_razor) seems to be the least amount of amount of over head to setup.

Put simply, the reason why Conway's Law holds true comes down to consolidation of power by individuals within a hierarchy.

Let's back up a second and add some context. Generally speaking, there are two career tracks for the software engineer: `individual contributor` and `engineering manager`. The first is what it says on the tin but the second is a little more nuanced. Technically speaking, an engineering manager should be parallel in the hierarchy from the individual contributor, however, often this dynamic is changed or exploited. Either by an over-eager engineering manager or individual contributors looking to abdicate responsibility. Either way, a small number of individuals end up making the decision for the organization. Quite coincidentally, these are not the same people who line up in the 20% of the Pareto Principal; and who, by and large, do the work. Competency is measured not in terms of personality traits by rather one simple factor: work ethic. 



Hence why decentralized command is so effective. It stands as a stark opposite of the traditional management hierarchy.
