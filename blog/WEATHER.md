# What Weather Forecasts Tell Us About Progress and Technology

Sitting next to the fire listening to the run tonight, it struck me that weather forecasts seem to be getting less accurate. In fact, even the most popular of apps is occasionally 10+ degrees wrong. It runs contradictory to what seems intuitive: there are clearly more satellites, more organizations, more people looking at weather data than ever. How could that contribute to a less accurate report?

The answer lies in a couple of factors:

* Too much data
* The need to grab the headline
* The fear of being wrong

## Too Much Data

The end of the 2010's saw the rise of data. Every organization took a hard look at its monitization strategy and realized they were leaving money on the table. Every interaction with a client now held two realized potentials in sale: one for the product and one for the data that was given away*.


*This isn't an blog post on personal data monitization or the ethics therein, hwoever, it is wise to be mindful of who you're giving information to, and in what capacity.


As we continue to progress technologically, the amount of available data increases exponentially. That increased data contributes to the "Noise v. Signal"


, and worse yet noise that contributes to the appeal to fringe or edge case events. Worse yet! Egged on by the need to increase ratings and to draw in viewers and users, much is often made about very little.
