## Creating a Kafka Consumer with Kafka, Kotlin, PostgreSQL, and Debezium

Continuing with tools of the trade, we're going to explore writing a Consumer for a Kafka topic in Kotlin. We'll generate these messages with debezium via an http endpoint so that the process will be end to end. Lucky for us, we can build on some of what we've already been working on to implement this solution.
