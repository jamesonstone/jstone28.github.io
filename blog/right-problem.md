# Are You Solving the Right Problem at the Right Level

![right problem, right level]()

The biggest problem in software development is solving the wrong problems at the wrong levels of abstraction. Before you immediately dismiss this statement as the ranting lunacy of an aging software engineer, think back to how many times you solved roughly the same problem; over and over again, almost unapologetically. We all know the maxim "don't reinvent the wheel". And, yet, we continue to do so. Even the most competent among us. Why is this? Well, to put simply, you've been fooled, but not in a malicious why, in an ignorant one. One that doesn't intake the whole picture before attempting to describe it. The antidote to this problem? A small realization:

> How a problem is presented dictates how we decide to solve it.

Let's breakdown that statement a little bit.

> How a problem is presented

The very process of making a problem communicable means a filtering down of the problem itself. Any filtering done by a human comes with it biases, conditions, and metaphor that very few others will relate to.

Whenever I attend an architecture review, I sit quietly attempting to read the biases of the presenter. I'll spend the remainder of the meeting trying to decouple the problem set from the contextual solution given. After all, an architecture review is really a solution-to-a-problem review. You can't properly assess a solution until you've agreed on the problem in a fundamental way.

Early in my career I used to be very frustrated by people who used this method on me. It always struck me as pedantic. Why do you need to know as much as I do about this problem. And why can't you just accept my explanation of it. Truth is, looking back, these individuals were my greatest critiques because they had the most reason to be. They knew better than I did, the problem and the pitfalls of my solution.
