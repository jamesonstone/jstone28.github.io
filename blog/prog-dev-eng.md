# Programmers, Developers, Engineers: What's the Difference

As an aspiring engineer, I was told of the difference between programmers, developers, and engineers. Most people use those terms interchangeably but if pedantics are in play then there is some subtle but useful differences. The following was how it was described to me and I hope it gives some clarity to why, in certain situations, someone might use one term over another.

**Programmers**:

Programmers are software plumbers. These are individuals who require a framework and an overview of each task that they are to work on. They require heavy guidence from their technical lead, and don't work well in situations meant to be autonomous. These individuals don't do well without explicit context and direction.

**Developers**:

Developers are software construction workers. They can take an existing structure and add on to it. These are individuals who can take a standard framework and extend it to provide a new feature set. Developers require context and direction but less so then Programmers.

**Engineers**:

Engineers are craftsman. You give them a high level business problem and they provide you with an end-to-end solution As software craftsman, they know their limitations and will seek out new skill sets to enhance their solutions.
